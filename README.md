  # Falling Leaves
  A pack used for showcasing falling leaves on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
</div>

This resource pack was created for the [Bedrock Add-Ons](https://discord.gg/EkTh6UQz6Z) Discord server during the "20k Add-On Jam". No longer updated because Mojang decided to add falling leaves to the base game a few days after the release of the pack.
